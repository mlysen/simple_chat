# A Simple chat

## Why?

This is a test project for me to learn SocketIO, nodejs with express and angularJS.

## How does it work.

- Install needed packages by running npm install in root folder.
- navigate to server directory.
- Run `node server.js`

- This will start a express server on port 3000.

- Connect to the server (e.g http://localhost:3000) using a compatible browser.
- If you're feeling lonelly use another browser to chat with yourself.

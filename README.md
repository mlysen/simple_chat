# A Simple chat

## Why?

This is a test project for me to learn SocketIO, nodejs with express and angularJS.

- Addition, simple mongoDB functionality as well.

## How does it work.

- Have mongoDB installed with a database called `simple_chat`.
- create a collection for `simple_chat` called `chat_messages`.

- Install needed packages by running npm install in root folder.
- runt grunt to create a runnable build.
- navigate to server directory.
- Run `node server.js`

- This will start a express server on port 3000.

- Connect to the server (e.g http://localhost:3000) using a compatible browser.
- If you're feeling lonelly use another browser to chat with yourself.
